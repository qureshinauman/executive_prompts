# Technology Investment Portfolio Analysis
Analyse technology investment data from the past quarter (Sep–Dec 2025) using emails, meeting notes, and budget documents stored in [specific folders or sources]. Produce a CFO-ready report that includes:
1.	Categorisation of technology spending into:
a.	Strategic initiatives (e.g., innovation, transformation projects)
b.	Operational maintenance (e.g., upgrades, support)
2.	Identification of investments with clear business outcome metrics versus those lacking measurable KPIs.
3.	Detection of redundancies or gaps across the technology portfolio.
4.	A prioritised recommendation list for next quarter (Q1 2026) investments based on:
a.	Strategic alignment
b.	ROI potential
**Output Requirements:**
•	Format as an executive summary (max 2 pages) with:
o	Overview of findings
o	Key insights and trends
o	Recommendations section
•	Include supporting data tables summarising:
o	Spend by category
o	KPI coverage
o	Identified gaps/redundancies
**Objective:**
Provide portfolio-level visibility to enable data-driven decisions and support budget discussions with the CFO and board. Ensure confidentiality of financial data; summarise sensitive figures rather than exposing raw details.
